      <h2>My experience:</h2>
      <p class="intro">
I started playing at the age of 11. I wasn't very happy when I started, but then I began to love it.
I have played in some orchestras in Udine, and then in summer time I played at a musical school in Spilimbergo. I have had with some lessons some of the best horn players in Italy. Now Iâ€™m studying it in the Conservatoire of Udine, but once a week I study with one of the horn players of the Fenice Theatre in Venice, where I have also played.</p>
